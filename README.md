 Assignment 1 
 5/30: Update to github after mini compupter crash yesterday so hoping the changes made before the hiccup will let me send to github
5/31: Made many changes this morning. mostly going back and forth until the right wording or whatever sticks. google, google, google....i do learn best by doing so stay positive through the frustration of learning. struggling with connecting html page to all the elements? on the css page. some work, some don't. was finally able to get flex to work this morning, at least the first row anyway.  thank goodness!
***i wonder if my fellow cohorts feel like they are getting much better at looking for answers in google***
5?31: Look at your notes from the meeting today, yeah, the one's you took before you fell asleep in class. I'm so embarressed. Saved in bootcamp_workspace>notes>doc.....when setting up the css files and the flexboxes be sure to set the parent container up first and the contents of the container are the children of the parent container. I believe this is why the code is working in the html file when setting properties on the line but not working when I move the code to the css file. 
6/:13-14:worked overnight on the assignment 1 project. I'm working on it but not really going anywhere with it--kind of like running on a treadmill...you're running but not going anywhere.
