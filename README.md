 Assignment 1 
 5/30: Update to github after mini compupter crash yesterday so hoping the changes made before the hiccup will let me send to github
5/31: Made many changes this morning. mostly going back and forth until the right wording or whatever sticks. google, google, google....i do learn best by doing so stay positive through the frustration of learning. struggling with connecting html page to all the elements? on the css page. some work, some don't. was finally able to get flex to work this morning, at least the first row anyway.  thank goodness!
***i wonder if my fellow cohorts feel like they are getting much better at looking for answers in google***
